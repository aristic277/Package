# Package

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Package is to show you how cool Disc Golf is. It is mega cool. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of Package from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("Package")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aristic277/Package")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(Package)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
head(DiscGolf, 5)
```
